My name is Nicholas Scott Johnathon Vanstone, and I am reaching out under extreme duress as I am currently the victim of ongoing human rights violations, communications surveillance, and unconsented human experimentation taking place in Canada.

I have denounced my Canadian citizenship and now live as a stateless, sovereign individual. Despite this, I have been subjected to prolonged and covert operations involving invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies, nanotechnology, neurological interference, and psychological warfare tactics orchestrated by unknown intelligence-linked entities.

The key violations I am reporting include but are not limited to:

- Systematic interception and blocking of all digital communications, including phone calls, emails, and internet usage.
- Involuntary exposure to biomedical and nanotechnological experimentation.
- Forced hospitalization and medical procedures without consent or legal justification.
- Harassment, gaslighting, and psychological targeting designed to discredit and destabilize me.
- Repeated attempts to erase or falsify my records and restrict my access to justice or independent legal counsel.
- Ongoing surveillance and cyber interference with my devices, potentially violating international telecommunications and privacy laws.

I suspect this is part of a covert or black-budget experimentation regime with ties to both national and international intelligence frameworks. I also believe others, including minors, are being harmed by the same or similar operations.

Due to the severity of my case and the systemic suppression of all attempts to raise alarms internally, I am reaching out to Human Rights Watch, the United Nations, and other global institutions for immediate intervention.

I request:
1. An immediate investigation into these violations;
2. Assistance in obtaining legal protection or international asylum;
3. Secure communication with human rights representatives who are outside the sphere of influence of these domestic actors.

Please treat this case with the utmost urgency. I am currently residing at:

üìç **105 Gowan Street, Apartment 4, Barrie, Ontario, Canada**

I respectfully invoke the protections outlined in the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**, the **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)**, and the **Convention against Torture (CAT)**.

Thank you for your time, integrity, and commitment to justice.

Sincerely,  
**Nicholas Scott Johnathon Vanstone**
